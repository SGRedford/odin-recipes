                </ol>
            <h3>Ingredients List:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
                    <li>¼ cup chopped onion</li>
                    <li>¼ cup chopped green bell pepper</li>
                    <li>¾ cup ketchup, or to taste</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar, or to taste</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon yellow mustard, or to taste</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
                    <li>6 hamburger buns, split</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Steps:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir lean ground beef in the hot skillet until some of the fat starts to render, 3 to 4 minutes. Add onion and bell pepper; continue to cook until vegetables have softened and beef is cooked through, 3 to 5 more minutes.</li>
                    <li>Stir in ketchup, brown sugar, mustard, and garlic powder; season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Divide meat mixture evenly among hamburger buns.</li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tips: If using ground beef with a higher fat content than lean, be sure to drain it before starting Step 2.</li>
